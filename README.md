This is my little Das Schwarze Auge (DSA. It's like german DnD meaning 10x more paperwork ;) Rule bot work in progress. It is retrieving and referencing correct rules already however populating the rules correctly is my current taks (their spread and formatted horribly). After that I want to extend it with a memory system for worldbuilding so it can take over as a DM and I can finally play with my round together^^
